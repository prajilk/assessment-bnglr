Equipment You’ll Need

Shutter Speed: Use long exposures (10-30 seconds) to capture more light.
ISO: Set your ISO between 800-3200, depending on your camera's noise performance.
Focus: Switch to manual focus and use live view to zoom in on a bright spot or distant light to achieve sharp focus.

Techniques to Try

Star Trails: Set your camera to a long exposure (15-30 minutes) to capture the movement of stars across the sky.
Light Painting: Use a flashlight or other light sources to 'paint' your scene during a long exposure.
Cityscapes: Capture the glow of city lights by using a smaller aperture (f/8-f/11) for a broader depth of field.

Post-Processing Tips

Noise Reduction: Use software like Lightroom or Photoshop to reduce noise in your images.
Adjust Exposure: Tweak the exposure settings to brighten up your photos if needed.
Enhance Colors: Boost the vibrancy and saturation to make the colors in your night photos pop.
